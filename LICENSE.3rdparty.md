The HSE code is generally licensed under the "Apache 2.0" license with two
exceptions. See hse/docs/SourceConventions.md for how this is to be indicated
within the HSE source files themselves.

# Exception - 3rdparty

The hse/3rdparty directory contains code not written by the HSE team but used by
HSE. Such code continues to be licensed under its original terms, but may exist
within the HSE tree with changes (typically small).

# Exception - External Sub-repos

There are some external projects that we build as sub-repositories (in sub/).
Licenses for sub-repos are documented in [sub/LICENSES.md](sub/LICENSES.md)

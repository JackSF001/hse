# Contributing to HSE

We are currently focused on collaborating with the open source community to
get HSE and its related components into popular Linux distributions,
and are not able to accept contributions at this time.
However, see the [HSE Wiki](https://github.com/hse-project/hse/wiki)
for how you can report a bug, make a feature request, provide feedback,
or ask a question.
